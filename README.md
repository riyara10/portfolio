# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
This project is a modern React-based portfolio website that showcases a comprehensive implementation of contemporary web development practices. The application features a multi-page layout with seamless client-side routing powered by React Router DOM, allowing smooth navigation between the Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections. The user interface is built using Material-UI components, providing a polished and professional look with responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. Google Fonts are integrated to enhance typography and visual appeal across all pages.

The project demonstrates practical use of React hooks, particularly useState for managing component state in forms and interactive elements, and useEffect for handling side effects like API calls and document title updates. The component architecture is organized into reusable Header and Footer components alongside dedicated page components, promoting code maintainability and scalability. The implementation includes dynamic content rendering, form validation, and interactive project galleries, making it a fully functional portfolio template that can be easily customized with personal content while maintaining clean code structure and modern development standards.
